## Go Bootcamp
This material aims to contribute to the learning of the Go programming languageüòç by collaborating with the community as a source of learning in the Go language. A material that covers what we need to know to start programming in the Go language üòç.
The content is aimed at the basic level of the student, many practical examples were made with rich details to make life easier for those who are starting in the language.
If you know little or almost nothing about programming, it won't be a problem, the entire manual was made for beginners to advanced levels.
I hope you like it and that it can serve as a basis for learning and help many possible Gophers.

There are thousands of references today regarding Golang, let's start from the beginning and we couldn't fail to mention the [Golang Tour](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1), [Play Golang](https://go.dev/play) or [Play Go Space](https://goplay.space/) are online ways to play with the Go language, isn't it beautiful? üòä

We created this page to help you find some links that we believe are essential for learning the Go language more easily:
* **[Go references](https://github.com/jeffotoni/gobootcamp/tree/main/references)**

We created a Go roadmap to make it easier to have a macro view when learning Go.
* **[Go roadmap](roadmap/goroadmap.png)**

The entire manual was based on the references presented above, and can be found here:
* **[gobootcamp](https://gobootcamp.jeffotoni.com/)**

We created this manual page
* **[Go manual](https://github.com/jeffotoni/gobootcamp/tree/main/gomanual)**
