# API zerohero üêøÔ∏è 
A simple example of a zerohero API inspired by the [superheroapi](https://superheroapi.com/) API.
This service is just starting and will be used in the Bootcamp and Hand-on at DevOpsFest.
Feel free to comment and collaborate by opening an [issue](https://github.com/jeffotoni/gzerohero/issues) and leaving your comments.

ZeroHero is an API that carries a database with superheroes and allows searches by biography, powerstats, connections, image, work and appearance.

Cool, isn't it üòç?. The goal is to understand the construction of a Go API using only the strand library.
In the json folder we have some superheroes so we can play around in our database.
Example of Odin JSON, they are found in the "json/" directory
```bash
{
   "response":"success",
   "id":"498",
   "name":"Odin",
   "powerstats":{
      "intelligence":"100",
      "strength":"83",

      "combat":"90"
   },

   },
   "work":{

   }
}

#### Docker Compose
We can use docker-compose to upload mongodb and the zerohero api, and it can also be run locally.
I usually comment out the lines of the zerohero service to debug and test everything before running the service locally and leave mongo in docker-compose.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d 
```

#### Go run
Clone zerohero and run the api locally

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jeffotoni/gzerohero.git
$ cd gzerohero
$ go run .
```
output:
```bash
2021/12/13 00:45:35 Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Now let's test our API ü¶æ

$ curl -i -XGET \
-H "Content-Type:application/json" \
